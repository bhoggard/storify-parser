== About this code

Script for parsing JSON feed for a storify.com story and writing out a new JSON file suitable for use in a widget. Content is "twitterized" so that links for hashtags, users, and URLs work as expected. This runs as a cron, and occasionally there are problems reaching Storify. Unless the verbose flag is set, it will silently stop if it fails to retrieve the JSON URL content.

== Prerequisities

Ruby - I'm using 1.9.2

Gems:

crack
htmlentities
json
trollop

== Usage

./parse-storify -h

./parse-storify -u <storify story JSON url> -o <path to output file>
